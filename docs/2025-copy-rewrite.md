#### H2: Common Questions
1. **How soon can I drive on fresh asphalt or sealcoating?**  
   Wait at least 24–48 hours, longer during humid or cold weather. We confirm reopening when the surface is ready.
2. **Do you offer financing or phased work?**  
   We provide good-better-best scopes, phase plans, and documentation so HOAs or property managers can schedule work around budgets.
3. **Which counties do you serve?**  
   Passaic, Bergen, Morris, Essex, Hudson, Union, Middlesex, Somerset, and Sussex counties (see Service Areas page for city list).
4. **Can you coordinate with other contractors?**  
   Yes—our team collaborates with builders, landscapers, plumbers, and electricians so trenches, lighting, or utility tie-ins align with paving.
5. **What maintenance schedule do you recommend?**  
   Sealcoat every 2–3 years, inspect cracks annually, and plan resurfacing or replacement when base failures or ponding appear.
